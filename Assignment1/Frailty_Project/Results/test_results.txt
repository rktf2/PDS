Range: 0 to 1 (some participants are frail, others are not)
Correlation Matrix:

Height & Weight: Moderate positive correlation (0.57), suggesting taller individuals tend to weigh more.
Height & Age: Very weak negative correlation (-0.03), indicating no significant relationship.
Height & Frailty: Weak positive correlation (0.19), implying taller individuals may be slightly more likely to be frail.
Weight & Grip Strength: Very weak positive correlation (0.03), suggesting minimal relationship.
Weight & Frailty: Moderate positive correlation (0.54), indicating heavier individuals might be more prone to frailty.
Age & Grip Strength: Very weak positive correlation (0.13), suggesting age alone may not be a strong predictor of grip strength.
Grip Strength & Frailty: Moderate negative correlation (-0.48), indicating that as grip strength decreases, the likelihood of frailty increases.
